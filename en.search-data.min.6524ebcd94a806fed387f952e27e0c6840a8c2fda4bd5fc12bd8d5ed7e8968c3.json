Sometimes these projects need soldering iron ready \u0026ndash; sometimes the microcontroller is enough.\nMicrocontroller is a one chip solution for processor, memory (RAM, flash and/or EEPROM) and input/output interface. These chips are programmable using low-level programming languages (such as C, assembly, etc.). The hard work is always done by compiler, which compiles the source code to target platform machine code.\n"}]
