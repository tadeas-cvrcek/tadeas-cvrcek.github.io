Sometimes these projects need soldering iron ready \u0026ndash; sometimes the microcontroller is enough.\nMicrocontrollers #  Microcontroller is a one chip solution for processor, memory (RAM, flash and/or EEPROM) and input/output interface. These chips are programmable using low-level programming languages (such as C, assembly, etc.). The hard work is always done by compiler, which compiles the source code to target platform machine code. Microcontrollers are suitable for embedded systems, due to their features and usual low-power consumption.\n"}]
