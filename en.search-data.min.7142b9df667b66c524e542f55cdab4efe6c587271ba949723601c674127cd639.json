Sometimes these projects need soldering iron ready \u0026ndash; sometimes the microcontroller is enough.\nMicrocontrollers #  A microcontroller is a one-chip solution for processor, memory (RAM, flash and/or EEPROM) and input/output interface. These chips are programmable using low-level programming languages (such as C, assembly, etc.). The hard work is always done by the compiler, which compiles the source code to target platform machine code. Microcontrollers are suitable for embedded systems, due to their features, usual low-power consumption and low manufacturing costs. Usually, these chips can be found in IoT (abbr. Internet of Things) projects, such as weather stations, smart home solutions or voice assistants.\nWhy are microcontrollers so popular? Mainly because they allow the creation of electronic projects with some kind of algorithms included to drive them. Microcontrollers can interact with physical switches, displays or LEDs and interface with a network at the same time. These capabilities make them useful for development (and prototyping) and even for production. To make it easy to start a development some software frameworks exist. Very popular is the Arduino framework. It is quite extensive, but also easy to learn and takes care of many \u0026ldquo;behind the scenes\u0026rdquo; events on the microcontroller. The new universal framework called Simba was published in 2015.\n"}]
